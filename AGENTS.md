# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
This repository captures personal dotfiles. Root-level scripts such as `install` and `alias` wire shell behaviour, while `zshrc` seeds a default shell profile. Editor customisations live under `nvim/`, with `init.lua` bootstrapping modules inside `lua/user/` (keymaps, options, plugins, resize helpers) and `colors/` providing scheme overrides. Terminal tweaks reside in `tmux/` (notably `tmux.conf` and the helper command `t`). Shared lint configuration sits in `luacheckrc`, and the Codex agent settings ship through `codex/config.toml`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `chmod +x install && ./install`: Symlink or copy configs into `~`, regenerating Neovim, tmux, alias, and Codex state.
- `tic -x tmux/tmux-256color.terminfo`: Register the included terminfo to unlock italics in tmux.
- `nvim --headless '+Lazy sync' +qa`: Refresh Lazy-managed plugins after adding or removing files under `nvim/lua/user/plugins/`.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Lua sources use two-space indentation, lowercase snake_case filenames, and prefer module-scoped tables over globals. Format Lua with `stylua nvim` before committing; when adding new style rules, update `stylua.toml` if introduced. Lint with `luacheck nvim/lua` so that `luacheckrc` guards against undefined globals. Shell snippets stay POSIX-compliant (`#!/usr/bin/env sh`), and tmux scripts should mimic the succinct option-setting style already present.

## Testing Guidelines
Run `luacheck nvim/lua` to catch regressions in Lua helpers. Launch `nvim --headless '+checkhealth' +qa` after plugin or LSP changes to confirm dependencies resolve. Exercise the `install` script inside a disposable user profile to verify links land in `~/.config`, `~/.local/bin`, and `~/.codex/` as expected.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Commits follow short, imperative messages (e.g., `add codex config`) without trailing punctuation; group related edits so diffs stay atomic. Pull requests should outline high-level intent, list any manual steps (such as rerunning `install`), and mention verification commands executed. Include screenshots or terminal captures only when visual changes occur (for instance, new tmux colours).

## Environment & Tooling Notes
Homebrew remains the primary installer for dependencies (Neovim, tmux, mysql-client, language runtimes); align versions with the README. Ensure Operator Mono and Hack Nerd Font are configured in iTerm2 before sharing theme changes. Mason manages language servers inside Neovimâ€”note new tooling in documentation and confirm corresponding binaries are available via `brew`, `pyenv`, or `rbenv` as outlined.
